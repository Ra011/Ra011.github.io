                                led a social club which included
                                organizing two in-person activities. I completed two personal projects, one of which was
                                a program in C to both check an inputted password strength and to generate a new, secure
                                password. My other project was creating a usb “rubber ducky”. I also presented my group
                                project in front of the entire academy, displaying my public speaking skills.</p>
